Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning



TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.


Here, i have implemented basic neural networks to understand the basic concepts features of a neural network.
Also, Computer vision area is explored and i have implemented convolution network to understand the functionality of tensorflow, keras.
